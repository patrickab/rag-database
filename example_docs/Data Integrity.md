Data integrity refers to the **accuracy, consistency, and reliability of data** throughout its lifecycle. It ensures that data remains unchanged and valid from its creation to its storage, retrieval, and eventual deletion.

There are two primary types of data integrity:

*   **Physical Integrity**: Protection of data from physical damage or corruption.
*   **Logical Integrity**: Focuses on the logical accuracy and consistency of data within a database.

Ensuring data integrity involves implementing various controls and strategies. These include:

*   **Access Controls**: Limiting who can view, modify, or delete data.
*   **Validation Rules**: Defining criteria that data must meet to be considered valid (e.g., data types, ranges, formats).
*   **Error Detection and Correction**: Implementing mechanisms to identify and fix inconsistencies or errors.
*   **Auditing and Logging**: Tracking changes made to data to maintain a history and detect unauthorized modifications.
*   **Backup and Recovery**: Regularly backing up data and having robust procedures to restore it in case of loss.

💡 The ultimate goal of data integrity is to build trust in the data, enabling reliable operations and informed decision-making.
