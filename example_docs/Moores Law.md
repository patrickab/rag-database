summary: An observation that the number of transistors on a microchip doubles approximately every two years, leading to increased computing power and decreased cost.

**Moore’s Law** states that transistor density on a microchip roughly doubles every two years,  while the cost per transistor decreases.

When transistor density **decreases**, several advantages occur
- electrons need to cover shorter distances &rarr; higher switching speed + higher locality
- **lower capacitance** (storage capacity / applied voltage) &rarr; same electric storage ability with less energy consumption
-  **lower operating voltage** is possible → further energy savings 

**Energy per switch ≈ C × V²**
- C = capacitance (↓ with smaller transistors) 
- V = voltage (which can also be reduced as transistors shrink)

As a result &rarr; **exponential growth** of *computing power* & *energy efficiency* over time.
