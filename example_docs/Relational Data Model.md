---
The relational data model organizes data into tables (relations) with rows (tuples) and columns (attributes).

**Roles in the Relational Data Model**

*   **Manipulators**: **Relational algebra** and **SQL** are used to query and modify data.
*   **Data Structure**: Data is organized into **relations** (tables) consisting of **attributes** (columns) and **tuples** (rows).
*   **[[Data Integrity]]**: Constraints (e.g., primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints) enforce data accuracy and consistency.
*   **[[Data Independence]]**: Users and applications are shielded from changes in physical storage structures or access methods.
