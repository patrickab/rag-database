Dynamic Random-Access Memory (DRAM) is a type of volatile semiconductor memory that stores each bit of data in a separate capacitor within an integrated circuit. It serves as the primary main memory ([[RAM]]) in most modern computers.

**Key Characteristics**
*   **Volatile**: Data is lost when power is removed.
*   **Dynamic**: Requires periodic "refreshing" (recharging the capacitors) every few milliseconds to prevent data loss due to charge leakage.
*   **Random-Access**: Any memory location can be accessed directly in roughly the same amount of time.
*   **High Density**: Offers high storage capacity at a relatively low cost per bit compared to SRAM.


**💡 Key Takeaways**
*   **Main Memory**: The most common type of RAM used for a computer's working memory.
*   **Capacitor-Based**: Stores data as electrical charges in capacitors.
*   **Requires Refresh**: Needs constant power and periodic refreshing to maintain data integrity.
*   **Volatile**: Data is temporary and lost upon power loss.
