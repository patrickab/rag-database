Principle in semiconductor manufacturing 

- as transistors shrink, their power density remains constant
	- voltage and current are scaled down proportionally to length
	- Faster, more power-efficient chips by doubling the transistor count without increasing power consumption.

Since 2004 Dennart Scaling has largely stagnated

This has primarily been caused by **current leakage**
- current leakage is energy lost to resistence of transistor material

This resulted in inability to consistently lower the **supply voltage** as transistors shrank.

**💡 Key Takeaways**

- **Constant Power Density**: The core principle was maintaining constant power density despite shrinking transistors.
- **Enabler of Moore's Law**: It allowed for the exponential growth in transistor count and performance for decades.
- **End of "Free Lunch"**: Its breakdown led to the "power wall" and the shift towards multi-core architectures and specialized accelerators, as single-core clock speeds could no longer increase freely.
